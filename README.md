# Diibmu

_noun_ hour; clock.

A visual countdown timer built using [raylib](https://raylib.com).

## Building for Linux and X11

TODO: implement the Makefile from the raylib starter game for cross platform
and wayland support. I just didn't want to deal with it for now. You probably need to adjust the LDFLAGS if raylib is not installed system wide.

Use make:

```
# build
$ make

# build and run
$ make run

# clean up
$ make clean
```
